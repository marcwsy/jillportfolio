This is a full stack website demo for my sister's animation portfolio

Intended to be a functioning portfolio website for Jillian to display her artwork to her clients/job prospects (if she wishes to use it lol). I thought it would be a fun project to try to learn more technologies such as Node.js, Express, Pug, and MongoDB. 

Thank you and image credits to:
